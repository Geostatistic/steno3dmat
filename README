Steno3D
*******

Welcome to the MATLAB client library for Steno3D (https://steno3d.com)
by ARANZ Geo Limited (https://www.aranzgeo.com).

WARNING: This library is in PRE-RELEASE. Please submit any issues or feedback on
github (https://github.com/3ptscience/steno3dmat/issues). There will very
likely be backwards-incompatible changes as development continues. You can
follow along with new releases at https://github.com/3ptscience/steno3dmat/releases.

If you have not yet installed Steno3D for MATLAB, you can
download the zip file (https://github.com/3ptscience/steno3dmat/releases/latest)
then in MATLAB:

    >> cd Downloads/
    >> unzip('steno3dmat.zip')
    >> cd steno3dmat
    >> installSteno3D

NOTE: Steno3D requires MATLAB version R2014b or later.

You also need to sign up for a Steno3D account (https://steno3d.com/signup).
From there, you can request a developer API key (https://steno3d.com/settings/developer).

At that point, login and start uploading your MATLAB figures

    >> steno3d.login()
    >> peaks;
    >> proj = steno3d.convert(gcf);
    >> proj.upload;

Function and API documentation is available from within MATLAB

    >> help steno3d;

or online (http://steno3dmat.readthedocs.io).

If you run into problems or if you see a new release on github
(https://github.com/3ptscience/steno3dmat/releases), you can upgrade in MATLAB:

    >> upgradeSteno3D

If your problems persist, please submit an issue (https://github.com/3ptscience/steno3dmat/issues).

Your version of Steno3D is 1.0.1. Detailed release notes are available

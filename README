Welcome to the MATLAB client library for Steno3D (https://steno3d.com)
by 3point Science (https://www.3ptscience.com).

If you have not yet installed Steno3D for MATLAB, you can
download the zip file (https://github.com/3ptscience/steno3dmat/releases/latest)
then in MATLAB (R2014b or greater):

    >> cd Downloads/
    >> unzip('steno3dmat.zip')
    >> cd steno3dmat
    >> installSteno3D

You also need to sign up for a Steno3D account (https://steno3d.com/signup).
From there, you can request a developer API key (https://steno3d.com/settings/developer).

At that point, you can

    >> steno3d.login()

then start uploading your MATLAB figures. Function and API documentation is
available through the MATLAB help browser or online (https://steno3d.com/docs).

If you run into problems or if you see a new release on github
(https://github.com/3ptscience/steno3dmat/releases), you can upgrade in MATLAB:

    >> upgradeSteno3D

If your problems persist, please submit an issue (https://github.com/3ptscience/steno3dmat/issues).
